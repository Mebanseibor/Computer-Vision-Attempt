### Deep Learning and computer vision
- Deep learning will tremendously aid in the goals of computer vision as it will leverage neural networks to identify and recognize the features of the image

- Promises that deep learning offers:
    - #### The Promise of Automatic Feature Extraction
        - Features can be automatically learned and extracted from raw image data
    - #### The Promise of End-to-End Models
        - Single end-to-end models can replace pipelines of specialized models
    - #### The Promise of Model Reuse
        - Learned features and even entire models can be reused across tasks
    - #### The Promise of Superior Performance
        - Techniques demonstration better skill on challenging tasks
    - #### The Promise of General Method
        - A single general method can be used on a range of related tasks


### Promises
- Promises:
    - [The Promise of Automatic Feature Extraction](#promise-1)
    - [The Promise of End-to-End Models](#promise-2)
    - [The Promise of Model Reuse](#promise-3)
    - [The Promise of Superior Performance](#promise-4)
    - [The Promise of General Method](#promise-5)

- #### <p id='promise-1'>Promise 1: Automatic Feature Extraction</p>
    - Here, extraction  of features refers to the extraction of features from a digital image to provide context for inference
    
    - The richer the feature, the better the inference
    
    - Multiple deep layers of the neural network model provides a deep hierarchy of rich features that can be learned automatically
    
    - Examples of methods or gitechniques:
        - Scale-Invariant feature transform (SIFT)
        - Gabor Filters
        - Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)

- #### <p id='promise-2'>Promise 2: End-to-End Models</p>
    - A pipeline with a raw image on one end and an outcome, such as a prediction, at the other end
