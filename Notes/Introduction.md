### <p id='content-whatwhyhow'>The What, Why and How?</p>
- #### What is computer vision?
    - Computer Vision (CV) is the field of study that uses techniques to help computers see and understand the content of digital images such as photos and videos

    - "*The automated extraction of information from an image*"

    - The goal of the machine with computer vision is to infer something from an image data

    - Typically, it seeks to use techniques and methods that attempt to reproduce the capability of human vision

- #### Why is computer vision relevant?
    - The internet consist of graphical media such as images and videos which would require indexing and searching.

    - Information may include:
        - Object detection
        - Object recognition
        - Camera position
        - 3D models
        - Grouping image content
        - Searching image content

- #### Why is Computer Vision hard to achieve?
    - Complexity inherent in the visual world, or in other words *visual perception* is an open unbound problem
    - Since we don't fully understand how human vision works

- #### How is computer vision achieved?



- #### How Computer Vision is different from Image Processing
    - Image Processing:
        - "*The process of creating an image from an existing image*"
        - It typically simplifies or enhances the content in some way
        - It does not concern itself with understanding the content of the images


- #### What has Computer Vision been able to do till date?
    - Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
    - Machine inspection
    - Retail
    - 3D model building (photogrammetry)
    - Medical imaging
    - Automotive safety
    - Match move
    - Motion capture
    - Surveillance
    - Fingerprint recognition and biometrics
